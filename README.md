The Gosu Language
=================

Gosu is a pragmatic programming language for the JVM. It has been designed with Java developers in mind by providing a set of features that allow them to be more productive without sacrificing the benefits of Java's simple syntax and type-safety. Gosu is an object oriented language with a sprinkle of functional programming features.

**Gosu features**:

* Open Type System
* Advanced type inference
* Program files (scripts containing statements, functions, and classes at the same level)
* Structural typing (similar TypeScript's interfaces)
* Extension methods (aka enhancements)
* Java interoperability
* Lambda expressions
* Classes/Interfaces/Enums
* Generics (reified, covariant type parameters and no wildcards)
* Composition (with the delegate keyword)
* Properties
* Null Safety (supports operator ?. etc.)
* Named Arguments and Default Parameter Values
* A powerful for each statement with user-defined intervals types
* Member Literals
* Object Initializers
* Classpath Statement and Shebang (useful when you use Gosu as a scripting language)
* ...and more
